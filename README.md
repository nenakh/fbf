# fbf

Short for "first brain first" (a play on the so-called "second brain" methodology), **fbf** is a tool to help generate and manage Anki cards from Markdown notes. Currently, the idea is to have a CLI-based tool that allows the user to interact with a directory of Markdown notes, and to use these notes to create flashcards from them. Eventually this idea might develop into a unique note-taking and flashcard toolâ€”although this is at the moment "future music", as the Germans say.
