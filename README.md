# tug

`tug` is a concept and a shell utility. The concept represents a personal attempt to constructively cope with the frustrations I've experienced using other tools. In particular, I've tended to struggle with the fact that disparate apps are needed to deal with activities that are, for me, deeply interrelated. Notes are tied to resources, tasks to notes, learning to notes and tasks, etc. And yet, we have learning apps, and we have to-do apps, and we have note-taking apps. Although some sort of relational network is possible using different apps, it generally feels convoluted, and ultimately unreliable and brittle.

I've also found that my happiness seems to have an inverse relationship with the amount of "stuff" I have, be it physical or digital. Most apps manage to offer both more and less than I want, so I end up with multiple apps, only using a fraction of each to achieve a "whole" system. So many apps also feel like simple window dressing for basic processes and workflows. With `tug` I hope to build a system that is both simple and powerful, flexible and robust.

At the moment I'm content to just explore ideas and address my own points of friction. With time I hope that a toolkit and system will emerge that others can benefit from as well.
