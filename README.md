The terminal-based tool `hirn` is meant to be a tool for managing notes, tasks, and flashcards. Although I enjoy using apps like Obsidian, Anki, and OmniFocus, they are all missing some features that would make them perfect (for me). In particular, they don't interact easily, or very well, despite strong overlap within my workflow. They are also simultaneously extremely flexible and inflexible: Flexible because you can "hack" them so much, inflexible because there are a number of things you can't do with them without very "hackish", and thus also very brittle, solutions. The goal of `hirn` is to create a purposeful  network of ideas and actions, rather than a stick-and-bubblegum amalgamation of different apps.

At this point I am simply in the process of exploring some core ideas:

1. Notes, tasks, and flashcards should be able to have different kinds of relationships with others of their type.
2. Notes, tasks, and flashcards should be able to have different kinds of relationships with other types.
3. Notes, tasks, and flashcards should all be based on simple text filesâ€“this even applies to things like scheduling.
4. Notes, tasks, and flashcards should each have more sophisticated, but still simple methods of interacting with and surfacing them.
