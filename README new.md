# MATTER

MATTER is a CLI-based tool

The starting point is the use of "physical matter"" as a metaphor for nonphysical, primarily cognitive units, processes, etc. This is reflected by the use of a nonstandard, even idiosyncratic, language to describe the various objects, their relationships, and the actions that can be performed on them.

## Objects

- mote
  - The most basic unit, generally consisting of a single "thing", be it documentable, memorizable, etc. In a sense "indivisible" in that it makes little sense to break it down into component parts, the true dimensions of any given mote is left to the discretion of the user.
- mass
  - Any aggregate of motes and masses as determined by the bonds between them.
- bond
  - The connection between any two objects, be they motes and motes, masses and masses, or motes and masses.

## Properties

Although their are only three classes of objects, every object can be associated with a number of properties. Certain properties are necessary in determining what sorts of things can be done with an object. For instance, "memorize" and "document" objects fulfill different functions, and will be treated differently as a result.

Bonds are just as much "objects" in this regard as motes and massesâ€”which is to say, bonds also have properties. Two properties unique to bonds determine the structure of masses by determining their density and their directionality.

Their can exist multiple bonds between any object pair, which allows networks of ideas to be viewed in different ways.
