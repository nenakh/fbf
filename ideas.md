# Basic principles

The idea is to have different files, and file types, that can
be related in different ways. The main object types will look something
like this:

- note
- card
- task
- source
- group

However, I've decided to use some unconventional language to
describe objects and actions because:

1. I hope it will help me break out of conventional thought patterns to open
me up to new approaches to old problems.
2. It's more fun.

For these reasons I've decided to map concepts above to a
more unique vocabulary:

- chunk → smallest unit of text
- glob  → flashcard
  - simple
  - cloze
  - occlude
  - principle
  - incremental
- thing → task
- stuff → source
- clump → an aggregation of objects into a new object
- pile  → an explicit collection of objects, like  a folder, but non-exclusive
- chain → a hierarchical sequence of objects
- bulk  → an implicit collection of objects
- 

The obvious metaphor is that of the shaping and forming of matter or
material.

- "verbs", i.e. functions
  - form   → create an object
    - `mttr form --chunk --glob --thing --stuff --clump --bulk --pile --mass`
  - fuse   → make a clump permanent, i.e. permanently merge the objects into
  one object
  - part   → the opposite of fuse, i.e. turn an object into a clump
  - scoop  → move some part of an object into its own object
  - plunk  → move some object into part of another object
  - behold → view
